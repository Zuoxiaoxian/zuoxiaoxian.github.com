      <description>PhDs awarded in selected disciplines, 2006-2016.
  Thierry Rossier asked me for the code to produce plots like the one above. The data come from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, a very useful resource for tracking trends in PhDs awarded in the United States. The plot is made with geom_line() and geom_label_repel(). The trick, if it can be dignified with that term, is to use geom_label_repel() on a subset of the data that contains the last year of observations only.</description>
